Telescope
======

A simple tool to allow easy bug report capturing within your app.

Usage
-----

Place a `TelescopeLayout` at the root of your hierarchy.

Add a callback to the view group with `setLens(Lens)`. Telescope provides two default
implementations:

* `EmailLens`: Compose an email with the provided addresses and subject (optional).
* `EmailDeviceInfoLens`: Enhances `EmailLens` by pre-populating the email body with app and device
  info

Screenshots will be stored on the external storage in `/Telescope/com.app.package/`. To have
Telescope clean up the screenshots folder, call `TelescopeLayout.cleanUp(Context)`. Ideally, this
would be called in the `onDestroy()` method of your `Activity` or `Fragment`.

If you are using the Gradle-based build system, you can wrap this view group around your activity
layouts only in the debug builds.



Permissions
-----------

By default, Telescope requires `WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` and `VIBRATE` permissions. To avoid
requiring these permissions, you can disable screenshots and/or vibration respectively.



Configuration
-------------

The view group can be configured as follows:

* Set the number of fingers to trigger with `app:pointerCount` / `setPointerCount(int)`
* Set the progress color with `app:progressColor` / `setProgressColor(int)`
* Disable screenshots with `app:screenshot` / `setScreenshot(boolean)`
* Screenshot children only with `app:screenshotChildrenOnly` / `setScreenshotChildrenOnly(boolean)`
* Set the screenshot target with`setScreenshotTarget(View)`
* Disable vibration with `app:vibrate` / `setVibrate(boolean)`
